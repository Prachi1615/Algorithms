# Algorithms
The project "Maze" investigates traversal algorithms for solving maze navigation problems. It compares Depth-First Traversal and Breadth-First Traversal methods, focusing on finding the shortest path. The project explores scenarios involving a legged robot and a self-driving car, demonstrating manual solutions and Python code implementations. Emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of Breadth-First Traversal in real-world applications like autonomous navigation systems.

Overall, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of traversal algorithms and their implications in solving maze navigation challenges, with practical implications for robotics and autonomous systems development.
